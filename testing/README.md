# Testing

This directory was put together to summarize the methods we tested for the project.


- In the metrics script we tested if custom loss functions produced expected results
- In the blur script we tested the effect of Gaussian Blur and its parameters
- In the inpaint script we tested different inpainting and smoothing tools for masks.
- In the preprocess_image script we tested different denoising and enhancing image techniques, including DRUNET.
